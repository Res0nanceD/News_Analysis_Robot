2022-05-13 20:32:51,"EMERGING MARKETS-Mexican peso rises after rate hike, Latam FX afloat for the week","* Latam stocks, FX eke out gains this week * Central banks in Mexico, Peru, Argentina hike interest rates * Brazil antitrust regulator approves sale of Petrobras refinery (Updates prices throughout, adds details) By Anisha Sircar May 13 (Reuters) - A gauge for Latin American currencies rose on Friday as the dollar dipped, clawing back some gains in a volatile week marred by risk-off sentiment on global growth fears, while Mexico's peso strengthened after its central bank hiked interest rates. Mexico's peso gained 0.7% against the dollar, bouncing off one-week lows after the Bank of Mexico on Thursday raised the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 7.0%, as expected. Peru's sol slipped 0.3% even after its own central bank raised rates by 50 basis points to 5%, the tenth consecutive hike as the copper-producing Andean nation battles spiraling inflation. Argentina's central bank, too, announced a hike in the benchmark interest rate by 200 basis points to 49% after data earlier in the day showed inflation in the 12 months through April was running at 58%. ""Inflation has risen to levels dangerous, and the only way in theory to combat that is raising rates, but central bank action isn't determining the value of foreign currency currently... We need global factors to come together for a more positive Latam outlook, as everything is so downwardly revised,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA. MSCI's index of Latam currencies edged 0.1% higher for the week, as it managed to keep its head above water after the greenback saw a boost in late April on U.S. rate hike expectations. Chile's peso and Colombia's peso hovered near pandemic lows. ""We're back to the levels of market fear and chaos as in the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 - 2022 is another moment of shock,"" Perez added, citing risks around China, rising U.S. interest rates, slowing growth and the war in Ukraine. Latin American stocks were headed for a 0.1% weekly gain by midday trading after a week which saw investors moving away from riskier assets amid broader recessionary fears, and were tracking their sixth straight week in the red. Headlines pointing to smoother commercial trade, new trade patterns with Latin American countries or a resolution in the Russia-Ukraine war could lift stocks in the weeks to come, analysts say. Brazil's real, Chile's peso and Colombia's peso were set for their fourth straight weeks in the red, skidding between 0.1% and 1.2% on the week. Petrobras shares jumped 1.7%, boosting Brazil's benchmark Bovespa. Brazil's antitrust watchdog CADE said the sale of the state-run oil company's Reman refinery to fuel distributor Atem was approved with no restrictions.

2022-05-13 19:48:45,TREASURIES-U.S. yields gain as market angst eases a bit,"(Updates prices) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - Treasury yields rose on Friday, reversing the week's rally in bond prices driven by the largest weekly inflows since the COVID-19 pandemic slammed markets in March 2020, as fears of a Federal Reserve policy error and runaway inflation eased. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose 11.8 basis points to 2.935%, helped by Labor Department data that showed import prices surprisingly were flat in April. That added to other signs of a moderating pace of inflation. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, would climb 0.6% after a 2.9% surge in March. Government data earlier this week showed monthly consumer prices increased at the slowest pace in eight months, while the gain in producer prices was the smallest since last September. ""It's been extremely volatile. We're whipsawing between inflation fears and then growth fears picked up. It's a tug of war between those two dynamics,"" said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics. In a week that started with the 10-year note yield hitting 3.203%, within 6 basis points of the 3.261% decade peak set in October 2018, BofA Global Research reported Treasuries saw $11.5 billion of inflows, the largest since March 2020. Yields on the benchmark Treasury bond have fallen more than 20 basis points this week after a sharp sell-off that pushed its yield up more than 125 basis points since early March. Bond prices move contrary to the direction of their yield. The data on import prices was a nice surprise, mostly due to weakness in petroleum, and year-over-year inflation will come down, ""so that might give a bit of reprise to the bond bulls and put bond bears back on their heels,"" Rupert said. ""We'll see intermittent rallies like we saw this week, where the growth scare dominates and we see rates decline a bit,"" she said. The Fed will do what it needs to do to bring down very high inflation, though how much will depend in part on how quickly energy and other supply constraints dissipate, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said on Friday. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose 12.1 basis points to 3.092%. A closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, seen as an indicator of economic expectations, was at 33.4 basis points. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 7.4 basis points at 2.597%. The breakeven rate on five-year U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) was last at 3.049%. The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate was last at 2.732%, indicating the market sees inflation averaging about 2.7% a year for the next decade. The U.S. dollar five-years forward inflation-linked swap , seen by some as a better gauge of inflation expectations due to possible distortions caused by the Fed's quantitative easing, was last at 2.700%.

2022-05-13 19:17:00,CANADA FX DEBT-Canadian dollar pares weekly decline as Wall Street rallies,"(Adds strategist quotes and details throughout, updates prices) * Canadian dollar strengthens 0.7% against greenback * For the week, the loonie falls 0.3% * Price of U.S. oil settles 4.1% higher * Canadian bond yields rise across curve By Fergal Smith TORONTO, May 13 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Friday as oil prices rose and equity markets globally clawed back some recent losses, but the currency still added to a string of weekly declines. The loonie was up 0.7% higher at 1.2950 to the greenback, or 77.22 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.2915 to 1.3049. ""We are still getting tugged around by risk sentiment,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank. Growth stocks led a rebound in Wall Street's main indexes in a week marred by worries about the worsening outlook for economic growth. The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, climbed on fears supplies would tighten if the European Union bans Russian oil. U.S. crude oil futures settled 4.1% higher at $110.49 a barrel. For the week, the loonie was down 0.3%, its seventh straight weekly decline. It touched on Thursday its weakest intraday level in 18 months at 1.3076. ""There's a pretty solid background story to the Canadian dollar at the moment - resilient growth, strong commodity prices, hawkish central bank - that's not been reflected in the CAD price action in the last little while,"" Osborne said. As Canada's economy overheats, the Bank of Canada is likely to be among the first of the major central banks to lift interest rates to a more normal setting even as worries persist about record-high levels of household debt, strategists say. April inflation data, due next Wednesday, could provide clues on the outlook for higher rates. Canadian government bond yields climbed across the curve, tracking the move in U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year was up 5.5 basis points at 2.956%, after touching on Thursday its lowest intraday level in 10 days at 2.887%.
